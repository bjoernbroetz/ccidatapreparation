Supporting Software
===================

CMOR
----

Well maintained software library with interfaces to python, C and Fortran. This software is recommended by the obs4MIPs task team to prepare the proposed dataset for submission.

Details and examples at: *climate model output rewriter* (`CMOR <https://cmor.llnl.gov>`_) 

The code is available at : `Github <https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor>`_

NetCDF
------

In general the `NetCDF <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf>`_ format is widely adopted in the modelling community of atmospheric and oceanographic science and beyond. The format is supported by many languages such as Fortan, C, Java, R or Python. The NetCDF data format allows for storing metadata alongside the numerical data. The numerical data is stored in a way that allows for good compression and good accessibility to subsets.  

Many educational resources about this format are available online such as this course from `Data Carpentry <https://carpentrieslab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/>`_.

cdo
---

Command line tool to: *"to manipulate and analyse Climate and NWP model Data"*. 

Active development with large community. Can be used to regrid data. The `cdo documentation <https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo>`_ is comprehensive and contains examples and tutorials.
