The dataset must have a version number assigned to enable a tracking of changes in the data. For the purpose of obs4MIPs there is no specific versioning format described.

The data provider is free in the choice of the versioning system. Guidance can be taken from the documents of the `RDA Data Versioning Working Group <https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-versioning-wg>`_, an expert group dedicated to this subject.
