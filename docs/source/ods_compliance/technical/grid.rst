Grid requirements
=================

The data needs to be provided on a global grid. In previous stages of obs4MIPs a 1x1 degree grid proved to be a good choice for the community but smaller grid sizes are possible too. The choice of the grid as well as the temporal resolution should be agreed with the obs4MIPs Task Team. 

The central reference document (`ODS v2.1 <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/DataSpecifications>`_) discusses the topic of *coordinate bounds* as optional but recommended information for the data set. Details on this shall be discussed with the obs4MIPs Task Team. Support can be received from the CMUG support.
