Grid requirements
=================

The data needs to be provided on a global grid. In previous stages of obs4MIPs a 1x1 degree grid proved to be a good choice for the community but smaller grid sizes are possible too. The choice of the grid as well as the temporal resolution should be agreed with the :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>`. 

The central reference document (`ODS v2.1 <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/DataSpecifications>`_) discusses the topic of *coordinate bounds* as optional but recommended information for the data set. Details on this shall be discussed with the :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>`. Support can be received from the :ref:`CMUG support<general_contact>`.
