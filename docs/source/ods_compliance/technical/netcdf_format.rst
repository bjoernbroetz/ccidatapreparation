Some notes about Netcdf are written in the section :ref:`NetCDF`.

The data subformat required for the CMIP6 model output is NetCDF version 4 classic (NETCDF4_CLASSIC), see `Taylor et al. 2018 <https://goo.gl/neswPr>`_. Therefor, the obs4MIPs data shall be also in the format NetCDF version 4 classic.
