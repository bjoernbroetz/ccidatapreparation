Required metadata
=================

The data provider needs to create a comprehensive set of metadata following the section "Global attributes" in the `ODS v2.1 document <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/DataSpecifications>`_. Those metadata need to be used also to define the actual filenames of the data files and also a well defined directory structure all specified in the ODS document.

It is highly recommended to make use of the *climate model output rewriter* (`CMOR <https://cmor.llnl.gov>`_) to prepare the dataset. In order to support the data provider with this task the CMUG support is available.
