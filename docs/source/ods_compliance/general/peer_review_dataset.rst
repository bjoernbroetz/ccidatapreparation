=====================
Peer reviewed dataset
=====================

The proposed dataset must be peer reviewed, with measurement source, construction methodology, calibration/validation and uncertainty described in one or more peer reviewed publications.

Furthermore, the dataset shall have a documented use for climate model evaluation, preferably in peer-reviewed publications. However, datasets with no or limited documentation regarding climate model evaluation can still enter obs4MIPs. This can be clarified in discussions between the data provider, the :ref:`CMUG support<general_contact>` and the :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>`.

With the newly introduced system of the six `indicators <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/DatasetIndicators>`_ the data providers can describe the level of "maturity with respect to climate model evaluation".
