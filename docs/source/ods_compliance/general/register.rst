============================
Register for the CMOR-tables
============================

The data provider needs to register a set of information about the new dataset and the providing institution. In the case that the proposed variable is not defined by the CMIP6 data request the data provider also needs to register this variable. The registration can be done by submitting an issue to the obs4MIPs-cmor-tables `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables>`_.

The information required is described in detail in the Appendix 2 of the ODS v2.1 document.
