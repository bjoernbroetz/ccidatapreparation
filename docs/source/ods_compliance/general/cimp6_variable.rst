CMIP6 variable
==============

The CMIP6 project (Coupled model intercomparison project, phase 6) declared sets of relevant variables required to be provided by the participating Earth system models. 

Any new observational dataset for obs4MIPs shall have a matching variable definition in the `CMIP6 data request <https://earthsystemcog.org/projects/wip/CMIP6DataRequest>`_ for its proposed variable. A comprehensive list and a useful variable search can be found at the `CMIP6 data request section: CMORvar <http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq>`_. 

In the case that there is no matching CMIP6 variable for the proposed dataset or doubt about it, please contact the CMUG support. Such data can be considered for ops4MIPs but require the additional steps:

 - Liaison with the *obs4MIPs task team*
 - Registration of the variable at the obs4MIPs-cmor-tables `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables>`_
 - Using the new `indicator <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/obs4mips/DatasetIndicators>`_ "Complexity of model observation comparison"
