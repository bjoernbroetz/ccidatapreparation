CMIP6 variable
==============

The CMIP5 and CMIP6 projects (Coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 and 6) declared sets of relevant variables required to be provided by the participating Earth system models. 

Any new observational dataset for obs4MIPs must have a matching variable definition in the `CMIP6 data request <https://earthsystemcog.org/projects/wip/CMIP6DataRequest>`_ for its proposed variable. A comprehensive list can be found at the `CMIP6 data request section: CMORvar <http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/CMORvar.html>`_. 

In the case that there is no matching CMIP6 variable for the proposed dataset or doubt about it, please contact the CMUG support.
