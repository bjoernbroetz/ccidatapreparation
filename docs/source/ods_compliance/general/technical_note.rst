Technical note
==============

The data provider must provide a technical note accompanying the proposed dataset that conforms to the obs4MIPs technical note template and the guidelines given within. The template is available from the obs4MIPs website `here <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/site_media/projects/obs4mips/Obs4MIPs_Technical_Note_Guidance_v3.1.docx>`_. The CMUG support will assist the data provider if required regarding all aspects of the technical note such as the level of detail or its over all form.

Technical notes will be hosted on the ESGF so that they appear along side the datasets to which they pertain.
