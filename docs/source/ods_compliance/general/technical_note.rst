Technical note
==============

The data provider must provide a technical note accompanying the proposed dataset that conforms to the obs4MIPs technical note template and the guidelines given within. The template is available from the obs4MIPs website `here <https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/site_media/projects/obs4mips/Obs4MIPs_Technical_Note_Guidance_v3.1.docx>`_.

Technical notes will be hosted on the ESGF so that they appear along side the datasets to which they pertain. 

Furthermore, the data provider can assign a DOI to the technical note and reference it from the metadata of the netCDF files of the data set. Details on this can be found in the section :ref:`DOI for the technical note`.
