Submission
==========

Once all requirements are fulfilled the data provider can send all material (netcdf-files that contain the data and metadata, the technical note, supplement material etc.) to the obs4MIPs task team and request a review. In an iterative process between the data provider and the obs4MIPs task team the provided dataset gets to its final form. If needed the CMUG support will assist during this process. 

Finally the data set will be submitted by the data provider to the ESGF node provider recommended by the obs4MIPs task team and the CMUG support.
