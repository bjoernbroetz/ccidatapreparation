===================
DOI for the dataset
===================

For the proposed dataset the data provider must have a DOI assinged. Just like for the technical note this can be easily achived by taking advantage of one of the several scientific online services like `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, or `figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ that offers long term archiving for documents and data with an DOI service attached.

In cases where this is not possible the data provider can contact the CMUG support to find a solution.
