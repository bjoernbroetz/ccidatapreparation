Publication
===========

Once all requirements are fulfilled the data provider can send all material to the :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>` and request a review. In an iterative process between the data provider and the :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>` the provided dataset gets to its final form. If needed the :ref:`CMUG support<general_contact>` will assist during this process. 

Submission
----------

Finally the :ref:`CMUG support<general_contact>` submits all material, which consists of  

 + the netCDF data files containing the new Obs4MIPs data set and metadata
 + the technical note
 + supplement material

to the ESGF node provider.  

DOIs for the data set and the technical note
--------------------------------------------

For the netCDF files of the data set and the technical note the ESGF node provider will assign a DOI and take care of the long term storage a DOI assignment implies. 

Publication on the ESGF
-----------------------

The ESGF node provider will follow its internal procedures to publish the material at the ESGF and will notify the data provider, the :ref:`CMUG support<general_contact>` and :ref:`obs4MIPs Task Team<general_contact>` once the data is online.
