Publication
===========

Once all requirements are fulfilled the data provider can send all material to the obs4MIPs task team and request a review. In an iterative process between the data provider and the obs4MIPs task team the provided dataset gets to its final form. If needed the CMUG support will assist during this process. 

Submission
----------

Finally the CMUG support submits all material, which consists of  

 + the netCDF data files containing the new Obs4MIPs data set and metadata
 + the technical note
 + supplement material

to the ESGF node provider.  

DOI for the technical note
--------------------------

The data provider can assign a DOI to the technical note and reference it in the metadata of the netCDF files of the data set. This can be easily achived by taking advantage of one of the several scientific online services like `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, or `figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ that offers long term archiving for documents and data with an DOI service attached.

Alternatively the ESGF node provider *contact page* can assign a DOI for the technical note as well using its own infrastructure.

DOIs for the data set
---------------------

For the netCDF files of the data set the ESGF node provider will assign a DOI and take care of the long term storage a DOI assignment implies. 

Publication on the ESGF
-----------------------

The ESGF node provider will follow its internal procedures to publish the material at the ESGF and will notify the data provider, the CMUG support and obs4MIPs task team once the data is online.
