==========================
DOI for the technical note
==========================

The data provider must have a DOI assinged to the technical note. In many cases this can be easily achived by taking advantage of one of the several scientific online services like `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, or `figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ that offers long term archiving for documents and data with an DOI service attached.

In cases where this is not possible the data provider can contact the CMUG support to find a solution.
